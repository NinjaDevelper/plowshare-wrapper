plowshare-wrapper
=================

Python wrapper for managing multi-host uploads and downloads using
[plowshare](https://code.google.com/p/plowshare/). After uploading it returns
an object with links to the file it uploaded. This wrapper contains both a
Python module and a command line tool.

#### Installation

Check [INSTALL.md](INSTALL.md) for installation instructions.


#### Module usage - Upload

This module is composed of a single class, which can be used to upload a file
to multiple hosts at once. Example:

    import plowshare

    p = plowshare.Plowshare()
    p.upload("/home/jessie/documents/README.md", 3)


The above example uploads the given file to three different hosts, chosen at
random from a predefined list. This list is a subset of the available plowshare
modules, limited to the ones that allow anonymous access. You can check it in
plowshare/hosts.py

You can also specify a list of hosts (plowshare module names) to use:

    import plowshare

    p = plowshare.Plowshare(['turbobit', 'multiupload', 'exoshare', 'rghost', 'bayfiles'])
    p.upload("/home/jessie/documents/README.md", 3)


The upload method returns an array of objects with the hosts and URLs to which
it uploaded the file. If some of the uploads fail, it doesn't return an URL,
but an error flag instead.

Here's an example:

    [
        { "host_name": "mediafire",  "url":   "http://www.mediafire.com/?qorncpzfe74s9" },
        { "host_name": "rapidshare", "url":   "http://rapidshare.com/files/130403982" },
        { "host_name": "anonfiles",  "error": true }
    ]

#### Module usage - Download

You can also download uploaded files, by providing the object that the upload
method generated, and the directory and filename where to download the file.
This method returns an object that contains the path where the file was
downloaded, or an object with the error message. Example:

    import plowshare

    uploads = [
        { "host_name": "mediafire",  "url":"http://www.mediafire.com/?qorncpzfe74s9" },
        { "host_name": "rapidshare", "url":"http://rapidshare.com/files/130403982" },
        { "host_name": "anonfiles",  "error":true }
    ]

    p = plowshare.Plowshare()
    p.download(info, "/tmp/", "readme_copy.md")


If it succeeds, `download()` returns an object with the full path filename:

    { "path": "/tmp/readme_copy.md" }


There are multiple errors that can occur. Here's a list of the currently supported errors:

    { "error": "no valid uploads" }     # the provided object does not contain any valid upload
    { "error": "plowshare error" }      # plowshare blew up


#### Command line tool usage

plowshare-wrapper comes with a command line tool to upload a single file to a
given number of anonymous hosts. If you have installed it by just cloning this
repository, you can run:

    plowshare/tool.py <file location> <number of hosts to upload to>

If you installed it using pip, type:

    python -mplowshare.tool <file location> <number of hosts to upload to>


For example, the following uploads this project's README to five different
hosts, chosen at random:

    plowshare/tool.py README.md 5

The command prints out a json representation of the result status object.
Details on the format of the json can be seen above.


#### Tests

Install development dependencies with:

    pip install -e '.[develop]'

Run:

    tox

This will run the test suite on Python 2.7 and 3.4.
